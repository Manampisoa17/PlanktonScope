If you have not yet assembled your PlanktoScope, go to the [Assembly Guide](assembly_guide.md).

## Install a mDNS client

To access the PlanktoScope services through your browser, you need to install a mDNS client.

If you are running a linux machine, you are in luck. Avahi-client is probably already installed on your machine. Check with your package manager.

If you are running a Windows machine, you will need to install the Bonjour service. It's a client developped by Apple. However, if you already use iTunes, Skype or even Photoshop, you may already have a client installed. Try skipping to the next step. If you can't access the linked page, come back here!

To install the client, download the installer [here](https://download.info.apple.com/Mac_OS_X/061-8098.20100603.gthyu/BonjourPSSetup.exe) and launch it.
