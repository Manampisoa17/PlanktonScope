## The context

Currently, a device called Planktoscope exists on the market. It is a portable digital microscope that can be used to analyze water samples in order to identify to identify the plankton species present. It has been manufactured to work with water of seas and oceans.

Our objective is to resume the research done on this device and to to modify it to make it more accessible from a point of view of use and to make it operational for operational for the fresh waters of the alpine lakes in particular by incorporating the treatment of plankton that are not present in the database at the moment. This will facilitate its subsequent deployment.

This project takes place at the LiPhy laboratory (Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique), a joint research unit attached to the University of Grenoble Alpes and the CNRS. Founded in 1966, it is located on the Grenoble campus in Saint-Martin-d'HÃ¨res.

The laboratory stands out for its multidisciplinary approach by interfacing physics with other disciplines such as mechanics or applied mathematics. Here, physics is not restricted, physics is used as a tool to decipher, create and produce complex phenomena. The main fields of activity of the laboratory are: optics, biophysics, fluid dynamics and soft matter.

## The need and the stakes for the customer

The main objective of this project is the realization of a replica of the PlanktoScope and the optimization of its microscope and its interface (CAD - Raspberry - Python - Node-Red).

It is thus a question of improving the initial object in order to make it usable for mountain lakes, to make it simple to set up and to make its use like "push-button" i.e. that the system must just be connected and its interface must be accessible.
