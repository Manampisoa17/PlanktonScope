# Plankton Net

The simplest device you can use is a plankton net. It should be made of a fine mesh, down to 20 micron. It can be towed behind a boat at low speed (less than 2 knots) or towed by hand in a river or a lake.

Plankton nets can be made easily with a good sewind machine and some hardware.
