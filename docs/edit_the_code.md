# How to help development for the PlanktoScope code

We are using the [Github Flow approach](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) for our development efforts.

If you want to join us, have a look at the [currently opened issues](https://github.com/PlanktonPlanet/PlanktoScope/issues) and pick one where you feel like you can have an impact. Let us know you want to work it in the comments and get started.

For working on Node-Red, we recommend to install it directly on your development machine to allow for faster cycles of testing (and ease of use). But feel free to setup a Pi Zero as a portable and compact development environment! (One of us is using one configured as usb gadget to do so!)

If you don't know how to code, [the documentation could use your help](edit_this_doc)!
