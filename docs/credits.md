# Acknowledgements

First, we would like to thank Mrs Salima RAFAÏ and LiPhy for proposing this very interesting project. Mrs. RAFAÏ was very present to guide us and to frame us in this project which was very beneficial for us.

Then we wanted to thank the [PlanktoScope](https://www.planktoscope.org/) community and especially Romain BASILE for his reactivity at the beginning of the project and Thibaut POLLINA for his feedback on our work at the end of the project. Thanks to the creators of PlanktoScope to have created this project by leaving it totally open source which allows us to work freely on it.

This project is based on the PlanktoScope to which we have made modifications. In addition, our documentation is also based on the [official documentation](https://project-lacoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to which we have added our specificities.

Thank you for your interest, we hope that this documentation has been useful to you.
