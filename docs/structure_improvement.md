# Architecture: 2D Plans
This page is a list of the different modifications and improvements on the 2D plans.

- To control the light environment and also have easy access to the lenses, we created magnetic lens access plates (Modification of the plates to add the magnets for the optical part). 
- To make the Planktoscope stable, we added feet on some vertical parts.
- To only use the laser cutter for the GPS and pump power connectors but also not to have the motor board power supply too close to the USB ports, we moved the connectors to the left side of the planktoscope and used 2 plexi partâ€™s (2 and 3 mm).
- To make the cables move less, we created a cavity so that the cables come out less easily.
