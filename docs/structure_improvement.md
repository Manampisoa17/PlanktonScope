# Architecture: 2D Plans
This page is a list of the different modifications and improvements on the 2D plans.

- Correction of errors on the base plans: Double lines, unrounded angles, screw holes with errors.
- Use of 5mm black plexiglass to better control the light environment for optics.
- Cutting the side plates in 3 pieces to access more easily to the lenses with a new magnetic plate system on the front and back of the Planktoscope.
- Modification of the place of the power holes of the motors and antenna because too close to the raspberry (short circuit and space management)
- Use of 2 plexiglass plates 2 and 3mm to fix the antenna and motors power supply. This avoids making a hole on a 5mm plate.
- Added a smaller hole at the entrance to avoid cables escaping.
- Added feet to the Planktoscope to make it stable in the vertical position.
- Cutting the plate supporting the Pump to fit different sizes.
- Modification of the plates to add the magnets for the optical part.
